OpenTrons *BETA* Release
=========

OpenTrons are affordable, easy to use biotech tools that can be connected together to make a modular lab automation system.

Here you will find the *BETA* release of the BetaBot App. It lets you connect to a BioBot, set up an automation job, and run it with an Android device. 

A BOM and assembly guide for our open-source, DIY liquid handling robot, the BioBot can be found here: https://www.synbiota.com/projects/535/workspace_pages

Technical Details
========

The OpenTrons app is made with Cordova. It uses HTML5 for the user interface and an Android plug-in for the business logic. 

The BioBot uses a TinyG motor control board to run its six stepper motors. The TinyG receives g-code from the Android device in JSON format over serial bluetooth. 

It is usable on a phone size device, but the best experience is with a 7‚Äù Android tablet.
