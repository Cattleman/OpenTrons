BRANCHES
========


SPECIAL PROJECTS ==> DEV ==> MASTER


* MASTER is the current production code. This is not updated very frequently.
* DEV is work in process.


SPECIAL PROJECTS (FEATURE BRANCHES):
* UI/UX is for playing with user interface and user experience everything (better to do after BOOM->SERVICE)
* USB-TOO is for making the Recipes run over a USB connection, not just the Bluetooth connection
* BOOM->SERVICE is for moving the BOOM functionality and some of the guts of MAINACTIVITY into the BETABOTSERVICE so 
  recipes run nicely in the background (separation of UI and backend).
* CHESS is to integrate chess notation playing functionality
  
in the near future... integrated web server/api, make the Mixbook "language" more formal so Mixbooks are nothing more than JSON or xml files, and better handling of CSV
