BRANCHES
========


SPECIAL PROJECTS ==> DEV ==> EDGE ==> MASTER


* MASTER is the current production code. This is not updated very frequently.
* EDGE branch is thought to be relatively stable, but has not received enough testing to be promoted to master.
* DEV is work in process and generally not a good idea to use. Use code from dev only if specifically directed there.


SPECIAL PROJECTS:
* UI/UX is for playing with user interface and user experience everything
* USB-TOO is for making the recipes run over a USB connection, not just the Bluetooth connection, shouldn't take too 
  long
* BOOM->SERVICE is for moving the BOOM functionality and some of the guts of MAINACTIVITY into the BETABOTSERVICE so 
  recipes run nicely in the background.
* CHESS is to integrate chess notation playing functionality
  
down the road... integrated web server/api, defining the Mixbook "language" so Mixbooks are nothing more than JSON or xml files, rather than CSV
