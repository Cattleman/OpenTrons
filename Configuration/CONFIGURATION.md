Configuration
=========

To successfully operate the BioBot, the TinyG requires a certain level of proper configuration. This guide provides 

instructions to easily configure the TinyG for operation and some additional information for troubleshooting and 

customization.

========
1st Step: Follow Synthetos' Guide For Connecting TinyG
========
The first thing you need to do is connect TinyG to your computer over USB in order to load the configuration settings. 

Synthetos provides a handy guide to do that, found here https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki/Connecting-TinyG#establish-usb-connection. 

Although there are many ways to interface with the TinyG, CoolTerm is the easiest, and Synthetos uses it in their guide. 

The rest of this guide picks up from there assuming you have connected to TinyG with CoolTerm.
